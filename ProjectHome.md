A 317 Runescape remake project done as a hobby. We have two developers currently:

Me (Momrocker/Xerxes): Original owner and main contributor

Azi: Newbie who's learning the ropes and helping around

The code is completely under the BSD 3-Clause License (or New BSD), because I personally think it's more "free" than the GPL (just my opinion). It allows the complete use of the server in binary or source code form, modified or unmodified, for any purpose as long as the BSD 3-Clause License is retained in reproductions of this material. The only other limiting factor is that the developer names or the name of our organization cannot be used to promote the product without written permission. Basically: do whatever you want with the source. In order to comply with the New BSD the license is included in the latest revisions (starting [r28](https://code.google.com/p/et06/source/detail?r=28)).

Also a big shoutout to "i am infamy" from moparscape for the base this is built off of, the thread for which can be found here: http://www.moparscape.org/smf/index.php/topic,550196.0.html
